This is a living post for what I use frequently, probably everyday. I'll update this periodically and welcome suggestions for improvements.

## Systems
* Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon with Ubuntu 20.10 ❤️
* Macbook Pro with Ubuntu 20.10, Windows 10, and MacOS
* Pixel 3 ❤️
* iPhone 8
* Ubiquity UniFi ❤️
* Sonnet Breakaway box with Nvidia 1070 ❤️

I prefer to work in Ubuntu but my personal laptop is a Macbook Pro which I got in 2017. It runs Ubuntu pretty well so I've kept it around. I also use it for gaming which is why I have a tri-boot configuration.

I have an iPhone from work but my main device is the Pixel 3. I've kept the iPhone because I like to compare functionality side-by-side and it's also handy to have a backup device on a different network provider.

## Developer Tools
* IDE: PHPStorm 💲❤️
* Editor: VS Code
* Terminal: Terminator

## Software
* Firefox mobile and desktop for my browser
* AutoKey for autocomplete ❤️
* CopyQ for clipboard management
* Dropbox for file storage
* Dropbox Paper for shared notes ❤️
* Flameshot for screenshots
* Authy for 2FA ❤️
* Spotify for music 💲❤️
* 1Password for passwords 💲
* Standard Notes for taking notes 💲❤️
* Google Keep for notes with reminders
* Google Calendar ❤️
* Google Photos ❤️
* Gmail for email
* Pocket Casts

## Service Providers
* GoogleFi 💲❤️
* Verizon 💲
* MonkeyBrains 💲❤️

## Financial Services
* Splitwise with roommate ❤️
* Robinhood
* SoFi
* Chase Sapphire Reserve Card 💲❤️
* Citi Double Cash Card

## Online Shopping
* Amazon 💲❤️
* Target
* Walmart

I typically price check anything I buy on Amazon and occasionally make purchases elsewhere but it's frustrating how often I regret buying things from anywhere other then Amazon due to shipping delays or issues. 😢

## Entertainment
* Amazon Prime Video 💲
* Netflix 💲
* Hulu 💲

## Communication
Communication platforms get an entire section because they are obnoxious. I unfortunately use all of these regularly since I cant convince the people in my life to standardize. I would pay so much for someone to fix this.

* Telegram
* GroupMe
* Slack
* Duo
* Facebook Messenger
* Discord ❤️
* Signal
* Snapchat
* WhatsApp
* Google Meet
* Zoom
* Google Hangouts (Sms)
* iMessage
* Email

The worst thing about the state of messengers today is that the only one of these I like using is Discord which is only useful to me when gaming. Facebook messenger is probably my second pick... but with reservations.

## Legend

* 💲 are monthly or annual subscriptions
* ❤️ are things that I love
